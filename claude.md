The analysis shows that the Electronics and Communication (EC) branch has the highest overall average feedback score, followed by Information Technology (IT) and then Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

Semester-wise, the 5th semester of EC has the highest overall average, followed by the 1st semester of EC.

Among subjects, Embedded System, Mobile & Wireless Communication, Software Practices, OOPS & Python Programming, and Electronics and Communication Engineering Project-I have the highest overall averages of 5.00.

Faculty-wise, Mr. L K Patel has the highest overall average feedback score, followed by Mr. M J Dabgar and Mr. S J Chauhan.
